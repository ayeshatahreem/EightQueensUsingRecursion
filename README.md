# EightQueensUsingRecursion
bool queens(int t[], int row, int col) where Input: integer array to store row numbers of queens as solution, rows and cols. 

In chess the queen is the most powerful piece on the board. She can move up and down, side to side, and diagonally, as many squares as she wants. The eight Queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
